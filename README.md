## 👋 About Me

I am an **offensive security professional** focused on identifying, exploiting, and clearly reporting real-world security vulnerabilities in web applications, APIs, and infrastructure.

My work combines:
- Manual, methodology-driven testing
- Automation using scripting
- Clear technical and executive-level reporting

I am especially interested in **Pentesting teams, Red Team environments, and security research**, where offensive skills directly contribute to reducing business risk.
